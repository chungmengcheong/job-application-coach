## Job Application Coach

Job Application Coach helps you maximize your chances of landing an interview.

### Product features
Job Application Coach is a web application that:
* Assess how the user's resume lines up against a job (description). 
* Provide a item-by-item assessment of how their experience and skills line up against a job's "must haves" and tactics to improve that alignment
* Interview them for potential additional relevant experience and skills that may not be on their resume, but might be relevant to the job 
* Recommends a redlined resume that frames the user's career narrative, experience and skills to best align with the job description, as well as phrasing tweaks to increase their ATS (Applicant Tracking System) performance
* [Future] Auto-complete the job application forms on their behalf!
* [Future] Identifies relevant 1st and 2nd degree contacts for networking into the job

Behind the scenes, Job Application Coach uses a custom AI pipeline incorporating the developer's years of career coaching and recruiting experience together with the latest LLM models.

### Using the application

The supported product is the web application at https://jobapplicationcoach.pythonanywhere.com. Chrome extension development and releases are frozen during the web-first refactor, so the extension is not a supported installation or release target today. A future extension may return as a thin client for browser-native capabilities after the web workflow is proven.


### Repo details
Note:
1. /backend: The FastAPI backend (plus various utils, e.g., authentication) that serves as the main orchestrator of the AI pipeline 
2. /web: The supported web client - plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, served by the same FastAPI app at `/app`
3. /demo: fixed synthetic inputs and canned API responses used by the permanent public demo
4. /evals: A collection of evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the AI models (future)
5. /prompts: A collection of prompt templates used by the AI models
6. /tests: A collection of unit tests for the backend, plus `tests/test_web_smoke.py`, a dev-only browser smoke test of `/web`


### Deploying on PythonAnywhere

#### First-time installation

Run these commands in a PythonAnywhere Bash console. The paths below match the
`jobapplicationcoach.pythonanywhere.com` deployment. The
`/home/jobapplicationcoach` prefix is the new free-account path; adjust it if
the account username differs.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/chungmengcheong/job-application-coach.git
   cd ~/job-application-coach
   ```

2. Create the virtualenv used by the web app and install the runtime
   dependencies. Use the virtualenv's Python explicitly; running bare `pip`
   can install packages into the user site instead of the web app's virtualenv.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.virtualenvs
   python3.10 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/jobapplicationcoach-venv
   ~/.virtualenvs/jobapplicationcoach-venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ~/.virtualenvs/jobapplicationcoach-venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create the production environment file and fill in the deployment values.
   Keep `.env` private; it is excluded from Git. At minimum, set
   `ENVIRONMENT=production`, the LLM and LangSmith keys, an authorized email or
   domain, and PythonAnywhere's HTTP(S) proxy values.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

   `ENVIRONMENT=production` disables FastAPI debug mode, which otherwise
   exposes tracebacks and internal exception detail in HTTP responses.

4. Create the FastAPI ASGI web app:

   ```bash
   pa website create --domain jobapplicationcoach.pythonanywhere.com \
     --command '/home/jobapplicationcoach/.virtualenvs/jobapplicationcoach-venv/bin/uvicorn --app-dir /home/jobapplicationcoach/job-application-coach --uds ${DOMAIN_SOCKET} backend.api:app'
   ```

5. Reload the web app after creating it or changing `.env`:

   ```bash
   pa website reload --domain jobapplicationcoach.pythonanywhere.com
   ```

#### Updating an existing installation

After each code update:

```bash
cd ~/job-application-coach
git pull origin main
~/.virtualenvs/jobapplicationcoach-venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
pa website reload --domain jobapplicationcoach.pythonanywhere.com
```

### Deploying locally

The backend serves the web client itself - one process, no separate frontend
dev server, build, or watch step:

```
source .venv/bin/activate   # if you're using the repo's venv
uvicorn backend.api:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/. Editing any file under `web/`
takes effect on the next refresh. Your `.env` already has `LLM_API_KEY`,
`GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `ALLOWED_EMAILS`, etc. set, so this should just work.

### Testing the web client

```
node --test web/tests/*.test.mjs                 # pure-logic unit tests
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt               # dev-only, not a runtime dependency
playwright install chromium                        # once
pytest tests/test_web_smoke.py                     # production-like browser smoke test
```
