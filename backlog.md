# Job Application Coach — Ordered Backlog

This is the single source of truth for implementation sequence. Work one
increment at a time and follow the listed item order unless new evidence changes
a dependency. Completed items move to [backlog-done.md](backlog-done.md) as they
land, so this file always reflects only remaining work.

`gates_release_type` records the earliest release that cannot proceed without
the item:

- `personal`: trustworthy personal production use
- `beta`: limited invited-user beta
- `general`: broader release
- `clean-up`: maintenance that does not gate a release

Entries marked **Confirmed** are supported by current code, tests, or build
configuration. **Validation risk** requires a live check.

## Cross-cutting testing and safety rules

- Write the behavioral assertion before fixing each confirmed defect.
- Normal tests must block live provider calls unless a fake is explicitly
  injected.
- Validate complete model output before replacing the prior valid artifact.
- Keep every test's mutable filesystem or database isolated.
- Validate canned demo fixtures and mocked live responses through the same
  consumer schemas.
- Preserve strict known-defect tests until the fixing increment makes them
  pass.
- Run focused tests, the complete backend suite, frontend logic tests, and the
  browser smoke test after each relevant increment. The web client has no
  compile or bundle step.
- Production validation is required for Google OAuth, Groq, hosting, and
  SQLite persistence; mocks do not establish those boundaries.
- Never log tokens, resumes, job descriptions, answers, raw prompts, or raw
  model responses.
- Keep production tracing disabled until explicit content, access, and
  retention controls exist.

## Increment 3.5 — Add durable users and stored resumes

Goal: Create the minimum durable personal data model from a fresh database.
Do not migrate existing `users` or `reviews`. Bootstrap one personal user
(`ccmmail@gmail.com`) and port the single `user/resume.txt` into that user's
stored resume, then remove the live file dependency without adding beta
onboarding concerns.

### Create the fresh SQLite personal schema

Add `users` and `resumes` tables plus the review ownership/resume references,
foreign keys, transaction boundaries, and a development-safe initialization
command. A pre-existing database is outside this increment's compatibility
scope: initialize the supported personal database fresh rather than importing
historical `users` or `reviews`. Do not add repository hierarchies, separate
artifact tables, model-call tables, or optimistic versions.

gates_release_type: personal

### Seed the personal user and resume

Idempotently create the user with canonical email `ccmmail@gmail.com` and
create its initial stored resume from `user/resume.txt`. Do not fabricate a
Google identity claim while seeding. On the first verified login for that
allowlisted email, attach the stable Google `sub` to the seeded user; use that
`sub`, not email, as the ongoing ownership key. A verified login may update a
missing or changed display/audit email.

gates_release_type: personal

### Resolve internal users from verified identity

Resolve or create a user from the verified Google `sub`. Use email for display
and allowlist audit, never as the ongoing ownership key. The seeded personal
email is the one explicit bootstrap association; do not create a second user
for the same verified `ccmmail@gmail.com` login.

gates_release_type: personal

### Support the stored resume

Allow each user to create, retrieve, and update a stored resume. The initial
personal workflow has one stored resume; active-resume selection and resume
history remain deferred until multiple resumes are needed.
Switch `POST /api/v1/reviews` to take `resume_id` instead of inline resume content, and
update the (already `/api/v1`-based) web client to load the user's stored
resume accordingly. Do not add archive or resume version history yet.

gates_release_type: personal

Exit gate:

- A fresh personal database contains one seeded `ccmmail@gmail.com` user and
  the ported `user/resume.txt` as that user's stored resume; historical users
  and reviews are not imported.
- A verified login binds that user to the Google `sub` without creating a
  duplicate user.
- Review creation takes an owned `resume_id` while retaining an immutable
  inline snapshot for both model calls.
- The legacy live `GET /resume` path and `user/resume.txt` dependency are gone.
- The canned demo remains a separate fixture-based experience.


## Increment 4 — Validate the production boundary

Goal: Verify the deployment assumptions required by the supported personal web
application before adding beta onboarding behavior.

### Verify and harden web authentication

**Validation risk plus confirmed defects.** Exercise callback registration,
state, nonce, expiry, logout, verified email, and unauthorized-user paths. Fail
closed when expected state or nonce is missing. The current client directly
implements Google's implicit endpoint flow even though it needs authentication
only, not access to Google APIs; replace that hand-built flow with Google
Identity Services Sign in with Google unless a concrete requirement justifies
keeping it. Decide explicitly whether the resulting browser credential remains
client-stored or is exchanged for a server session rather than preserving
`localStorage` by default. Fix the confirmed backend defect that currently
treats a missing `email_verified` claim as verified.

gates_release_type: personal

### Validate the deployed personal workflow

Exercise login, stored-resume loading, Call 1, answers, Call 2, redline, and
reload in the deployed web app.

gates_release_type: personal

### Validate SQLite on the production host

Verify durable filesystem behavior, locking, backup/restore, deployment
persistence, and overlapping writes before beta. Move to managed Postgres only
if these assumptions fail materially.

gates_release_type: beta

### Validate Groq from the production host

Verify the supported model, proxy behavior, timeouts, safe errors, and usage
capture through the thin client.

gates_release_type: personal

### Verify production tracing is disabled

Confirm `LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2=false`. Do not trace beta-user prompt or response
content without explicit content, access, and retention controls.

gates_release_type: personal

Exit gate:

- Every production validation risk is converted to verified behavior,
  configuration work, or a reproducible defect.


## Increment 4.5 — Add authenticated one-time trial onboarding

Goal: Let a new visitor obtain one custom review without turning the canned
demo into a live unauthenticated provider endpoint. Durable users and resumes
already exist and the personal production workflow has already been validated.

### Collect trial inputs ephemerally

Allow a visitor to enter a resume and job description before authentication.
Keep them only in browser memory. Make no LLM call and persist no sensitive input.

gates_release_type: beta

### Require authentication and explicit submission

After authentication, show what will be submitted and require an explicit
action. Create the internal user, store the resume, create the owned review,
and then run the normal two-call workflow.

gates_release_type: beta

### Define one-time eligibility and abuse controls

Specify what makes the trial one-time and apply input, token, timeout, and rate
limits. Do not weaken ownership or create an unauthenticated Groq endpoint.

gates_release_type: beta

Exit gate:

- No sensitive trial input is persisted and no provider call occurs before authentication and explicit submission.
- The resulting resume and review are owned by the newly created user.
- The canned demo remains a separate fixture-based experience.

## Increment 5 — Prove limited-beta isolation

Goal: Safely extend the working product to a handful of invited users.

### Scope every store operation by owner

Require the authenticated internal user for all resume and review reads and
writes. Return the same not-found result for missing and other-user resources.

gates_release_type: beta

### Add two-user concurrency and authorization tests

Run overlapping review, follow-up, resume update, and forbidden-access
scenarios for two identities.

gates_release_type: beta

### Add retention and deletion controls

Define development-period retention and provide explicit user/operator deletion
before expanding beyond the invited beta.

gates_release_type: beta

### Add proportionate operations support

Add safe structured request/review logging, health/readiness checks, backup and
restore instructions, and a repeatable deploy/rollback procedure.

gates_release_type: beta

Exit gate:

- Two users can run overlapping workflows with no cross-user access or state
  corruption.
- The beta has a tested release, backup, and rollback path.


## Future decision — Reassess a thin browser-native extension

After the web workflow is reliable, test whether these jobs justify a second
client:

- extract a job description from the active page;
- assist with user-approved application-form completion; and
- inspect relevant networking context.

If retained, build a thin purpose-built extension over the proven API. Reuse UI
components only where demonstrated sharing is cheaper than purpose-built UI.
Do not automatically restore the current extension architecture or introduce
platform adapters before the decision.

gates_release_type: clean-up

## Explicitly deferred

These are not ordered implementation commitments:

- SSE, WebSockets, event sequencing, or browser-visible provider streaming;
- persisted demo sessions and demo refresh continuity;
- a three-stage LLM workflow;
- artifact/answer/final-resume version checks;
- separate artifact and model-call tables;
- multi-provider abstractions;
- advanced automatic retry orchestration;
- finalized-resume persistence;
- Chrome extension implementation until the browser-native jobs are reassessed;
- Postgres unless SQLite production validation fails;
- active-resume selection and resume history until multiple stored resumes are
  needed.
