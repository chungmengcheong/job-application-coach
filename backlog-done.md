# Job Application Coach — Completed Backlog Items

Completed items are cut from [backlog.md](backlog.md) and pasted here verbatim,
in completion order, each tagged with the commit that landed it. This file is a
completion record, not a second source of truth: sequencing and exit gates for
remaining work stay in backlog.md.

## Increment 1 — Fix personal correctness and isolate the canned demo

Goal: Make the existing personal workflow trustworthy before restructuring it.
Preserve the current LLM workflow in this increment.

### Preserve the submitted job description through follow-up

**Confirmed.** `/review` does not save its job description, while `/questions`
rereads the demo-seeded global file. Bind the follow-up to the original submitted
job description and working resume.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `/review` now writes the submitted job description to `JOB_DESCRIPTION_FILE`
before generating the prompt, so `/questions` reads the same value back. Fixed
`tests/test_api.py::test_follow_up_uses_original_submitted_job_description`
(previously a strict xfail).

### Fix startup cleanup semantics

**Confirmed.** One missing temp file stops deletion of later files. Remove files
independently as an interim correction.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: lifespan startup now calls `Path.unlink(missing_ok=True)` on each stale
temp file independently instead of one `try`/`except` around sequential
`os.remove` calls. Fixed
`tests/test_api.py::test_lifespan_removes_each_stale_file_independently`
(previously a strict xfail).

### Disable production debug behavior and sanitize errors

**Confirmed.** FastAPI uses `debug=True`, and provider exception text can reach
clients. Add environment-specific debug configuration and stable safe errors.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: added an `ENVIRONMENT` env var (default `development`); `FastAPI(debug=...)`
is now `False` only when `ENVIRONMENT=production`. The `/review` provider-exception
handler no longer interpolates the raw exception into the client-facing detail
message. README's PythonAnywhere deployment steps and `.env.production` now
document/set `ENVIRONMENT=production`. Fixed
`tests/test_api.py::test_provider_exception_does_not_leak_internal_detail`
(previously a strict xfail); added
`tests/test_test_safety.py::test_debug_is_disabled_when_environment_is_production`
and `::test_debug_defaults_to_enabled_outside_production`.

### Enforce verified email before allowlist authorization

**Confirmed.** Discovered while working Increment 1: `check_authorized_user`
ran the `ALLOWED_EMAILS`/`ALLOWED_DOMAINS` allowlist check before checking
`email_verified`, so an allowlisted-but-unverified email claim was accepted
instead of rejected. Not in the original backlog item list; added here as a
personal-gating security correctness fix alongside the debug/error-sanitization
item above.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `check_authorized_user` now checks for a present, verified email first
and raises 401 before any allowlist check runs. Fixed
`tests/test_security.py::test_authorization_rejects_allowlisted_but_unverified_email`
(previously a strict xfail).

### Add the minimum typed review schemas

Add Pydantic contracts for the current fit, gaps, questions, tailored resume,
and safe error responses. Do not introduce schemas for future streaming events,
artifact versions, or a three-stage workflow.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `backend/schemas.py` adds `Fit`, `GapItem`, `ReviewResult` (the shared
fit/gaps/questions/tailored-resume shape), and `SafeError`. Not yet wired into
routes — that lands with the next two items (validating LLM output before
mutating state, and aligning demo/live responses through the same schema).
Added `tests/test_schemas.py`, which validates both checked-in demo fixtures
against `ReviewResult` and asserts round-trip and rejection behavior.

### Validate LLM output before changing state

**Confirmed.** Parse and validate the complete provider result before rotating
or replacing prior valid artifacts. Add bounded repair or safe failure for
invalid JSON and missing required fields.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `generate_review` now parses and validates the raw provider response
against `ReviewResult` before rotating `OUTPUT_FROM_LLM_CURRENT_FILE` or
writing `RESUME_REVISED_FILE`. Invalid JSON or a schema mismatch (e.g. a
missing `Tailored_Resume`) raises a 502 and leaves all prior state untouched;
no bounded repair was added since a safe failure satisfies the item and keeps
scope minimal. The response body is now built from the validated model via
`model_dump(by_alias=True)` rather than the raw parsed dict. Fixed
`tests/test_api.py::test_invalid_llm_json_does_not_replace_prior_valid_state`
and `::test_missing_tailored_resume_does_not_replace_prior_valid_state`
(previously strict xfails).

### Keep the canned demo but make it read-only and isolated

Retain the checked-in synthetic resume, job description, initial response, and
follow-up response. Demo calls make no LLM request, require no account, create no
session, and never read or write live `user/` or `temp/` workflow state.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `/resume?demo=true` now returns `RESUME_DEMO_FILE` directly instead of
copying it over the shared live baseline first. `/jobdescription` with
`demo=true` now reads `JOB_DESCRIPTION_DEMO_FILE` (a dedicated demo fixture)
instead of `JOB_DESCRIPTION_FILE`, which after the job-description follow-up
fix now holds whatever job description a live user last submitted. Fixed
`tests/test_api.py::test_demo_resume_load_does_not_mutate_live_baseline`
(previously a strict xfail); added
`::test_demo_job_description_never_reads_live_temp_state`.

### Align canned demo and live consumer contracts

Validate demo fixtures and mocked live responses against the same schemas and
frontend consumer assertions. Exact model wording need not match.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `/review` and `/questions` now declare `response_model=ReviewResult`,
so every response on either route — demo fixture or live/mocked LLM output —
is validated and serialized through the identical schema on every request,
not just checked once against a fixture snapshot. Added
`tests/test_api.py::test_review_and_questions_enforce_the_same_response_schema`.
`tests/test_schemas.py` (added under "Add the minimum typed review schemas"
above) already covers offline validation of both demo fixture files.

## Increment 1 exit gate — met

- A live review and follow-up use the same submitted job description and resume.
- Invalid model output leaves the prior valid state intact.
- Repeated demo calls cannot change live state and make no provider call.
- Production responses do not expose debug or provider exception details.

`tests/test_api.py::test_invalid_resume_command_returns_client_error` remains a
deliberate strict xfail: it is a "planned contract" item (an unhelpful
`/resume?command=delete` currently returns HTTP 200 with an `{"error": ...}`
body instead of a 4xx), not a "confirmed" defect, was never a named backlog
item, and is not part of the Increment 1 exit gate above. It fits naturally
with Increment 3.5's replacement of `/resume` by typed `/api/v1/resumes`
endpoints with one safe error envelope, so it is left for that increment
rather than patched piecemeal here.

## Increment 1.5 — Adopt the two-call Groq workflow

Goal: Make the user journey match the evidence-gathering logic and make Groq the
single supported provider.

### Baseline the current workflow

Capture representative output quality, token use, latency, and failure behavior
before changing prompts or provider configuration.

gates_release_type: personal

**Skipped by explicit user decision** (2026-08-18): proceed straight to the
Groq cutover without a baseline capture; see "Compare against the baseline"
below, also skipped.

### Introduce a thin injectable, config-driven LLM client

Switch the supported provider from OpenAI to Groq. Isolate provider syntax,
timeouts, model configuration, usage metadata, and raw response handling behind
one small client that tests can replace. Do not build a multi-provider adapter
framework.

Refined by explicit user decision (2026-08-18): make the client fully
config-driven rather than Groq-named, since Groq's chat completions API is
already OpenAI-schema-compatible — no per-vendor translation logic is needed.
`backend/llm_client.py`'s `LLMClient` wraps the generic `openai` SDK pointed at
a configurable `base_url` (default: Groq's OpenAI-compatible endpoint), with
model, reasoning effort, and max completion tokens all overridable via
`LLM_MODEL` / `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` / `LLM_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` env vars.
This is one call path, not per-vendor branching, so it does not count as the
multi-provider adapter framework this item still says not to build.

gates_release_type: personal

### Compare against the baseline

Confirm that the two-call flow does not materially reduce evidence fidelity,
truthfulness, fit quality, or resume coherence.

gates_release_type: personal

**Skipped by explicit user decision** (2026-08-18), alongside "Baseline the
current workflow" above.

### Implement Call 1: analysis and questions

Input the selected resume and job description. Return validated fit, gaps, and
targeted questions. Do not generate a tailored resume in Call 1.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `POST /review` now runs a dedicated Call 1 prompt
(`prompts/prompt_call1_analysis_GOLD.txt`) built by `create_call1_prompt()` and
validates the result against the new `AnalysisResult` schema (`Fit`, `Gap_Map`,
`Questions`). `Tailored_Resume` is not a field on that schema at all, so Call 1
cannot return one even if the model tries. The raw validated response is saved
to `OUTPUT_FROM_LLM_CURRENT_FILE` for Call 2 to read back.

### Implement Call 2: revised analysis and tailored resume

Input the same resume, the same job description, and the user's answers. Return
validated revised fit, revised gaps, and a tailored resume. Generate the redline
deterministically only after the complete resume validates.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `POST /questions` no longer delegates to `/review`'s handler. It builds
its own Call 2 prompt (`prompts/prompt_call2_tailor_GOLD.txt`, via
`create_call2_prompt()`) from the same resume baseline, the job description
Call 1 persisted to `JOB_DESCRIPTION_FILE`, Call 1's raw `Fit`/`Gap_Map` (read
back from `OUTPUT_FROM_LLM_CURRENT_FILE`), and the submitted `qa_pairs`, then
validates the result against `ReviewResult` (`Fit`, `Gap_Map`,
`Tailored_Resume`; no `Questions` field). The deterministic redline is
generated only after `Tailored_Resume` validates.

Refined by explicit user decision (2026-08-18): keep today's PascalCase field
names (`Fit`, `Gap_Map`, `Questions`, `Tailored_Resume`) on the split responses
rather than adopting the lowercase `fit`/`gaps`/`questions`/`tailored_resume`
example in docs/api.md's Increment 1.5 section. The snake_case rename now
belongs to the Increment 2/3 `/api/v1` typed client cutover, not this increment
— renaming twice was judged worse than renaming once at the right boundary.
docs/api.md has been updated to show the actual PascalCase contract.

### Update the web workflow and tests

Show fit, gaps, and questions after Call 1. Show revised fit, revised gaps, and
the tailored redline after Call 2. Test both calls with injected responses; the
normal suite makes no paid calls.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `ReviewData` (`extension-panel.tsx`) and `ReviewResponse` (`lib/api.ts`)
mark `Tailored_Resume` and `Questions` as optional, matching the two response
shapes. The review panel only renders the follow-up questions/answer form when
`Questions` is present (Call 1 state) and instead shows a "tailored resume is
ready" notice once `Tailored_Resume` arrives (Call 2 state); the Resume tab
already fell back to the plain baseline resume when no tailored resume exists
yet, so it needed no change. Backend tests inject fake `prompt_llm` responses
shaped for each call (`tests/test_api.py`, `tests/conftest.py`); the normal
suite still makes no paid calls. Demo fixtures were updated to the per-call
shapes: `demo/API_response_review_demo.json` has no `Tailored_Resume`,
`demo/API_response_review_add_info_demo.json` has no `Questions`.

## Increment 1.5 exit gate — met

- Call 1 (`POST /review`) returns only fit, gaps, and targeted questions.
- Call 2 (`POST /questions`) uses the original resume and job description plus
  answers and returns revised fit, revised gaps, and a tailored resume.
- The canned demo remains deterministic and makes no LLM call.

## Increment 2 — Introduce the Review service and durable API

Goal: Replace global workflow files with a durable `Review` record and a
minimal API, without yet introducing durable users or stored resumes. Owner
and resume are inline/denormalized for now; both grow a durable identity in
Increment 3.5.

Refined by explicit user decision (2026-08-18): drop the "additional
candidate info" file input (`user/additional_candidate_info.txt`) rather than
keep reading it server-side. The documented `POST /api/v1/reviews` request
body (`resume`, `job_description`, `source_url`) has no field for it, and
Increment 2 does not reintroduce a home for it; `ReviewService` reads only the
resume content and job description captured on the review itself.

### Add SQLite configuration for reviews

Create a `reviews` table with a development-safe initialization command. Do
not add `users` or `resumes` tables yet, and do not add foreign keys to them;
that schema work is Increment 3.5.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `backend/db.py` defines the `reviews` table (no `users`/`resumes`,
no foreign keys) and `init_db()`, which only ever runs `CREATE ... IF NOT
EXISTS` — safe to call on every process startup, never destroys data. The
path defaults to `data/reviews.db` (now gitignored) and is overridable via
`REVIEWS_DB_PATH`. `python -m backend.db` runs it standalone as the
development-safe initialization command. `backend/api.py`'s `lifespan` calls
it on startup in place of the old temp-file copy/cleanup it used to do.

### Make Review the durable unit of work

Persist owner (the verified Google `sub`, not yet a durable `users` row), the
submitted resume content, immutable job description, answers JSON, validated
result JSON, simple status, safe error, and timestamps. Use `processing |
awaiting_answers | completed | failed`.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `backend/review_store.py`'s `ReviewRecord`/`ReviewStore` persist
exactly this shape. `result_json`/`answers_json` transitions use `COALESCE`
against the existing column value, so a Call 2 failure records
`status="failed"` and a `safe_error_code` without erasing Call 1's already-
stored fit/gaps. Added `tests/test_review_store.py`.

### Add a thin ReviewService and SQLite store

FastAPI routes own HTTP concerns; `ReviewService` owns the two-call workflow;
one SQLite store module owns review persistence; the existing deterministic
redline function remains a function.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `backend/review_service.py`'s `ReviewService` builds each call's
prompt from the review's own stored `resume_content`/`job_description` (never
global files), validates provider output against the existing
`AnalysisResult`/`ReviewResult` schemas before persisting it, generates the
redline via the unchanged `redline_diff` only after Call 2's tailored resume
validates, and maps provider/validation failures to `backend/errors.py`'s
`ApiError` (`MODEL_CALL_FAILED` / `MODEL_INVALID_OUTPUT`, both 502,
retryable). Added `tests/test_review_service.py`, including assertions that
neither prompt contains an `Additional_Info` key.

### Implement the minimal JSON API

Add:

```text
POST   /api/v1/reviews
GET    /api/v1/reviews/{review_id}
POST   /api/v1/reviews/{review_id}/answers
```

`POST /api/v1/reviews` takes the resume content and job description directly;
there is no `resume_id` yet. `GET /api/v1/me` and `/api/v1/resumes/*` do not
exist until Increment 3.5 introduces users and stored resumes.

Use one safe typed error envelope.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `backend/api_v1.py` mounts a dedicated `FastAPI` sub-app at
`/api/v1` (`app.mount("/api/v1", api_v1_app)` in `backend/api.py`) with all
three routes, each authenticating via the existing `verify_token`/
`check_authorized_user` and scoping by the verified `sub`. `backend/errors.py`
registers the safe envelope (`{"error": {"code", "message", "request_id",
"retryable"}}`) only on this sub-app, so the legacy/demo routes' error shape
is untouched. A review that fails Call 1 or Call 2 returns an HTTP error
(404/409/422/502, matching today's failure-class precedent) rather than a 201
with a `failed` body; the row is still durably written first, so `GET
/api/v1/reviews/{review_id}` remains the recovery path if a client loses the
response. Missing and other-owner reviews return the same `NOT_FOUND` 404.
Added `tests/test_api_v1.py`, `tests/test_db.py`.

### Cut over without a compatibility facade

Switch the single supported web client to `/api/v1` in a coordinated change.
After verification, remove the old live endpoints and global workflow files.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `backend/api.py` dropped every `temp/`-scoped constant, the
lifespan temp-file copy/cleanup, and the live branches of `/review` and
`/questions` (auth, prompt building, LLM call). Those two routes, plus
`/resume` and `/jobdescription`, now serve only the permanent canned demo (and,
for `/resume`, a plain authenticated getter for the one operator resume's
text) — they are not a compatibility facade for the live workflow, since no
code path in them reaches an LLM or the reviews store. `BrowserExtension/lib/api.ts`'s
`postReview`/`postQuestions` branch on `demo`: the demo path is byte-for-byte
unchanged (still `/review`/`/questions`), and the live path now posts to
`/api/v1/reviews` / `/api/v1/reviews/{id}/answers` and unwraps the `{id,
status, result}` envelope back into the flat shape `extension-panel.tsx`
already expected, plus a new `reviewId`. This is intentionally the smallest
frontend change that makes the live path correct; the typed client that
formally replaces this ad hoc unwrapping is Increment 3.

Exit gate:

- Both calls use the immutable resume content and job description captured at
  review creation.
- A review and its follow-up are durable and recoverable by review ID.
- Review ownership is scoped by the verified Google `sub`, even though there is
  no durable `users` table yet.
- The supported live workflow has no `temp/` dependency.

## Increment 2 exit gate — met

- `create_review`/`submit_answers` (`ReviewService`) always read the
  `resume_content`/`job_description` captured on the `Review` row at
  creation, for both calls.
- `GET /api/v1/reviews/{review_id}` recovers a review and its answers by ID
  after the fact (`tests/test_api_v1.py`).
- Every `/api/v1` route scopes by `claims["sub"]`; missing and other-owner
  reviews both return `NOT_FOUND` 404.
- `backend/api.py` no longer references `temp/`; `lifespan` only calls
  `init_db()`.

## Increment 2.5 Consolidate scattered backend configuration - Done

Landed (`73110c2`, `2dc41c6`, ): Created a 
`pydantic_settings.BaseSettings` singleton in `config.y` for non-secret operational defaults. Added
`backend/paths.py` for the structural, never-overridden file-path constants.

gates_release_type: clean-up

## Increment 3 — Simplify the web client around the durable API

Goal: Make the web application deliberate, restorable, and independently
maintainable without Chrome abstractions.

Refined by explicit user decision (2026-08-19, recorded in
`plan-refactor-frontend.md`): rewrite the web client as plain HTML/CSS/JS
with no build step (`web/`), served by the same FastAPI app as `/api/v1`,
rather than refactoring `BrowserExtension/`'s Next.js/React app in place.
Rationale: the product surface is small, most of `package.json` was dead
weight unrelated to being "a webapp that grew out of a Chrome extension",
and one FastAPI-served origin removes a whole cross-origin surface (CORS, a
build-time `BACKEND_URL`, a second deploy target). A git tag
(`chrome-extension-last-working`) was cut before starting, satisfying the
later Cleanup item's "preserve a tagged Git reference" concern immediately.
`BrowserExtension/` was left entirely untouched — nothing was ported from it
line-for-line; `web/` is written fresh, porting only actual *behavior*
(`resume-renderer.tsx`'s redline logic, the OAuth callback's state/nonce
handling), not files.

### Add a shared fetch helper

Centralize `/api/v1` requests, safe-error-envelope parsing, authentication
headers, and timeouts in one small module. Do not add a build step, a
framework, or event-stream parsing.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `web/js/api.js`'s `apiFetch` centralizes the bearer header
(from `web/js/auth.js`'s stored token), a timeout (150s for the two model
calls, 30s elsewhere, via `AbortController`), and safe-error-envelope
parsing; it attaches the HTTP status to the thrown `Error` so callers can
distinguish 401 from 403. `createReview`/`getReview`/`submitAnswers` are
one-line wrappers, not a schema-mirroring typed client. `loadLiveResume`
also lives here (not in `demo-api.js`) since it needs the same auth header,
even though its route (`GET /resume`) predates `/api/v1` — Increment 3.5
replaces it with `resume_id`. `web/js/demo-api.js` is a separate module for
the canned demo's non-`/api/v1` routes (`/review`, `/questions`, `/resume`,
`/jobdescription`), whose response/error shapes differ from the durable
contract. Added `web/tests/api.test.mjs`, `web/tests/auth.test.mjs`
(`node --test`, no `package.json`).

### Introduce explicit workflow state

Separate durable server state, in-flight/loading state, and local editing
state. Derive what the UI shows directly from the review's own status
rather than a separately maintained state name. Authentication must not be
inferred from loaded resume content.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `web/js/workflow.js` holds exactly `review` (the current `ReviewOut`
or a demo-mode equivalent shape), `authenticated`, `demoMode`, `loading`,
`error`, and `notAuthorized`. `render()` derives which top-level `<section>`
is visible from `review?.status` plus `loading`, with no separate
client-side workflow-state enum. `authenticated` is set only from
`auth.js`'s stored-token presence/checks and 401 responses
(`review-workspace.js`'s `handleApiError`); a 403 instead sets the distinct
`notAuthorized` flag and leaves `authenticated` untouched.

### Apply the minimum module split

Extract only a review workspace, review display, and redline editing around
the fetch helper and review state. Resume management and active-resume
selection do not exist yet; add that module in Increment 3.5, once stored
resumes exist. Split further only when behavior becomes independently
complex.

gates_release_type: clean-up

Landed: `web/js/review-workspace.js` is the orchestrator (DOM wiring,
submit/answer actions, header auth/demo controls). `web/js/review-display.js`
renders fit/gap-map/question-form HTML. `web/js/redline.js` owns
accept/reject/edit. `web/js/redline.js` parses the backend's `<add>`/`<del>`
markup into segments addressed by array index rather than by re-matching the
original markup substring — the prior React port
(`resume-renderer.tsx`)'s `tailoredMarkdown.replace(originalMarkup, ...)`
targeted only the first textual match, wrong when two changes carry
identical markup. Toolbars use CSS `:hover`/`:focus-within` instead of
JS-tracked hover state, simpler than the ported component. No resume-selection
module or generic tab-router was added.

### Build a deliberate full-page web product

Remove Chrome-only controls and fixed side-panel assumptions. Serve the web
client from the same FastAPI app as `/api/v1`, retiring the separate Vercel
deploy. Add responsive review routes, accessible loading/error states, and
restoration by durable review ID. Resume routes arrive in Increment 3.5 with
stored resumes.

gates_release_type: beta

Landed: `web/index.html` is one document with all view states as `<section>`
blocks in normal responsive document flow (`web/css/styles.css`, plain
flexbox/grid, no Tailwind). `backend/paths.py` adds `WEB_DIR`;
`backend/api.py` mounts `app.mount("/app", StaticFiles(directory=WEB_DIR,
html=True))` plus an explicit `GET /app/reviews/{review_id}` route
(registered before the mount, since a static mount alone 404s on a path with
no matching file) that serves the same `index.html` for the SPA-fallback
pattern. `web/js/main.js` reads a review ID out of `location.pathname` and
hydrates via `GET /api/v1/reviews/{review_id}`; on a successful live
`createReview`, `review-workspace.js` calls `history.pushState` so the URL
becomes bookmarkable/refreshable. Demo mode never changes the URL. Loading
gets `role="status" aria-live="polite"`; the error banner gets `role="alert"`;
restoring a review from a fresh load moves focus to a heading
(`#workspace-heading`, `tabindex="-1"`). `backend/config.py`'s
`cors_origins` is now `[]` (same-origin web client needs none; only the
frozen Chrome extension's origin, assembled separately, still applies).
`static/index.html`'s "Try in browser" CTA now points at `/app/`. Keyboard
operability for redline accept/reject/edit remains a real gap, not
addressed here (hover-driven, as before).

### Confirm the supported web client needs no build step

Plain HTML/CSS/JS has no package manager, lockfile, bundler, or compiler to
standardize. Add a production-like browser smoke test exercising the
two-call demo flow, and any pure-logic unit tests, run non-interactively.

gates_release_type: beta

Landed: no `package.json` under `web/` at all. `tests/test_web_smoke.py`
(dev-only — `requirements-dev.txt` adds `playwright`/`pytest-playwright`,
not a runtime dependency; `pytest.importorskip` skips cleanly without them)
starts the real `uvicorn backend.api:app` in a subprocess against a
throwaway database and drives a real Chromium browser through the full
demo Call 1 → answers → Call 2 flow, plus a durable-review-ID restoration
test (seeds a stored token and intercepts the one `GET
/api/v1/reviews/{id}` call via Playwright route mocking, since live Google
OAuth is Increment 4's job) confirming `main.js`/`workflow.js`/
`review-display.js`/`redline.js` hydrate a fresh page load correctly.
README.md and `docs/frontend.md` document the one local workflow
(`uvicorn backend.api:app --reload --port 8000`, browse to `/app/`) and the
two test commands (`node --test web/tests/*.test.mjs`,
`pytest tests/test_web_smoke.py`).

Exit gate:

- Refresh restores a durable review from the backend — verified end-to-end
  in `tests/test_web_smoke.py` via a seeded token and an intercepted
  `GET /api/v1/reviews/{id}` response, since live Google OAuth registration
  is validated separately in Increment 4.
- The supported web client's tests (`node --test web/tests/*.test.mjs`) and
  browser smoke test (`pytest tests/test_web_smoke.py`) pass
  non-interactively; there is no build, typecheck, or lint step to run.
- `grep -rn "chrome\." web/` returns nothing — `web/` was written fresh and
  never imported from `BrowserExtension/`.

### Refine the two-call review workspace

Make the review tabs and follow-up interaction explicit without changing the
underlying two-call model workflow. Keep the Questions for You interaction
available for revision after Call 2 and make the canned demo self-guiding.

gates_release_type: personal

Landed: `bd4e252` separates Questions for You into its own tab, disables it
until Call 1 exists, preserves questions and answers through Call 2, and
allows a completed review to rerun Call 2 with updated answers. The job-fit
panel now provides navigation actions for answering questions and viewing the
proposed resume; the resume tab is labelled Proposed resume after Call 2.
Demo mode pre-fills the follow-up answers after the job description is
submitted. Added durable API/service/browser regression coverage and kept the
palette values centralized in the CSS root variables and aligned in the
splash page.


## Cleanup — Archive the frozen Chrome extension implementation — Done

Landed after Increment 3 established that the supported `web/` client had no
imports from or runtime dependency on the frozen implementation.

- Preserved the last working Next.js/React and Chrome-extension implementation
  at Git tag `chrome-extension-last-working`.
- Deleted the obsolete `BrowserExtension/` tree rather than renaming it;
  `web/` is already the supported web-oriented directory.
- Deleted the checked-in generated release under `releases/dist-extension/`.
- Removed the extension-only `/oauth2cb` bounce, Chrome CORS origin, extension
  ID setting, and their test.
- Updated the architecture, frontend, authentication, and README notes to
  distinguish the retired implementation from the still-open future extension
  hypothesis.

gates_release_type: clean-up

## Increment 3.1 — Rename project and cut over the public deployment

Landed in `138ba6a` to rename the project to **Job Application Coach** and make `jobapplicationcoach.pythonanywhere.com` the canonical deployment before Increment 3.5 creates the first supported personal database.

- Renamed the public GitHub repository to `job-application-coach`; the local Git remote points to the renamed repository.
- Registered the new production origin and exact `/app/auth-callback.html` OAuth callback, then verified live login on the new host.
- Kept stable operational identifiers where renaming would create migration work: browser storage keys, SQLite table names, the `data/reviews.db` filename, and the LangSmith project name.
- Passed the focused tests, complete backend suite, frontend logic tests, and browser smoke test against the renamed codebase.
- Created the new PythonAnywhere app from a fresh checkout and virtualenv under `/home/jobapplicationcoach`, set production environment values, initialized the fresh database, and verified the deployed two-call workflow.
- The old `/home/airecruitingagent` path belongs only to the previous account and rollback deployment.
